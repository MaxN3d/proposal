Installments:
- Have Python 3.X
- Download the "Tkinter" library (this makes the graphics)

Once everything is installed...
- Run in terminal as python project.py
- Type in name or not
- Make selections and click "get my list"
- pop-up list should appear based on your choices

This is a project made for people who are indecisive like I am when it comes to doing a lot of important things. By giving people choices on what they feel like doing that day, it helps you become more productive!
