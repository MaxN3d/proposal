## Description
As a Senior that is about to graduate, I wanted to create a program that would generate a list of things I could work on based on what I wanted to do that day. I think this would be helpful for others in different creative fields since sometimes finding the right thing to do in a da can seem daunting.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- I wanted each list to feel personal so the user will be able to input their own name so it feels like the program is addressing the directly
- Feature 2
	- There will be a selection of choices the user may choose from for each question. The selected choice from all of the question(s) will result in a combined list (user response) as apart of the program
- Feature 3 
	- After compiling all the answers, a detailed list of activities to do that day will appear for the user.

## Challenges
- I think one of the biggest challenges is going to be making a list to match every combination of answers along with making sure no combinations get missed.
- I think I might look into a way to optimize how to get to each combination a list, like having certain combinations get the same or similar list
- Since all of this will be within the python terminal, I also want to look into what can be added into the terminal so it does not look blank

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Once all answers are submitted, the user will receive a unique list based on their inputs

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Once all answers are submitted, the user will get a list that share the same qualities as other similar combinations

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Pseudo code finished
  2. Lists for half of combinations

- Week 2
  1. First part of program revised and finished
  2. Lists completed

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Second half of code completed and full program completed
  2. Terminal decoration and final touches
